<h2>About</h2>
<p>Originally from Los Angeles, Alexzandra began violin at age 7 and her viola studies at age 16. 
  A recent graduate of the Bard Conservatory of Music, Alexzandra has had the opportunity to study with Honggang Li from the Shanghai Quartet at Bard and at Montclair State University. 
  In addition, she earned a diploma in Computer Science from Bard College. 
  Prior to attending Bard, Alexzandra was a violinist in the pre-professional American Youth Symphony. 
  Her previous violin teacher is Alexander Treger, the former concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
  She made her viola debut performing the Mozart Sinfonia Concertante at the LA County Museum of Art's Bing Theater with the Crossroads Chamber Orchestra and with the Palisades Symphony after winning their Concerto Competition. 
  In Spring 2018, Alexzandra and her sister soloed with the Orchestra Now again performing Mozart's Sinfonia Concertate. 
  Alexzandra has had the opportunity to work with artists such as the Shanghai String Quartet, Steve Tenenbom, Masumi Per Rostad, Leon Botstein, Charles Castleman, Michael Tree, and Jeffrey Kahane. 
  She has performed all across the world in halls such as Disney Concert Hall, LACMA's Bing Theater, Bard College's Sosnoff Theater, David Geffen Hall, and the Marinsky Theater. 
  She founded a Davis Projects for Peace supported initiative, which mentors underprivileged violists in the Orquesta Sinfónica Infantil y Juvenil de Siloé in Cali Colombia. 
  Alexzandra has toured with the Bard Conservatory Orchestra to Cuba and Europe and participated in the Banff Center's Master Class Program as well as the Orford Music Festival. 
  This summer Alexzandra will attend Aspen Music Festival. <br> <br> At Bard College, Alexzandra was co-president of the Women in STEM club where she organized panels featuring speakers from Facebook, UIPath, and renowned faculty from the NYC area. In addition she co-founded a club called CodeRed which distributed free menstrual supplies to women across campus, including free menstrual cups thus reducing Bard College's environmental footprint. 
She completed her senior thesis called, "Thinking Outside the Box" which using images of assembled shipping boxes, estimated thevolume of any size container. It enabled shipping/moving optimization as leading shipping companies only factor in box weight, not dimensions.
